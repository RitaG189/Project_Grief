  denialCaptions:
  - You open a book and stare blankly at the pages. The words don't register. This
    isn't real. None of this makes sense.
  - You hold the book, but you're not really here. {animal} will curl up on your
    lap any second now. You wait. The weight never comes.
  - You try to focus but your mind keeps slipping away. This must be a mistake. It
    has to be.
  - You sit with the book unopened. {animal} will jump up and demand attention any
    moment. You keep waiting. The cushion stays empty.
  - The letters swim across the page. You read the same sentence six times without
    comprehending. Your brain refuses to process anything.
  - You turn a page out of habit, but nothing is sinking in. Reality feels thin,
    like paper.
  angerCaptions:
  - You try to read but the words blur with rage. This is bullshit. You slam the
    book shut so hard it echoes.
  - You glare at the empty cushion where {animal} used to sleep. It's not fair. Why?
    You're so angry you can't see straight.
  - The pages turn but you're seething. The injustice chokes you. You want to throw
    the book across the room.
  - You grip the book tight enough to hurt. {animal} deserved more. You deserved
    more time. The unfairness burns.
  - Every word on the page feels like an insult. How dare the world expect you to
    sit here and read like everything's normal?
  - You try to focus but fury keeps flooding in. The book deserves to be ripped apart.
    Everything deserves to be destroyed.
  bargainingCaptions:
  - You pick a different book. Maybe new things will hurt less. Maybe if you avoid
    the memories, you can function. Please.
  - 'You make yourself a deal: read one chapter without crying. If only you''d spent
    more time with {animal} instead of reading.'
  - You read the same paragraph over and over. If you stay right here, frozen, maybe
    you won't have to face what comes next.
  - You tell yourself if you finish this book, you've made progress. If only you
    could go back. If only.
  - 'You set a timer: read for ten minutes and you''ve earned a break. Small goals.
    Manageable pieces. Maybe this is how you survive.'
  - You choose the lightest book you can find. Maybe if the content is easy enough,
    your brain can handle it. Maybe you can trick yourself into feeling normal.
  depressionCaptions:
  - You open the book but the words swim through tears. What's the point of reading?
    What's the point of anything?
  - You try to read but end up sobbing quietly. {animal} used to rest their head
    on your knee. Now there's just emptiness.
  - You sit with the book forgotten in your hands, drowning in sadness. Everything
    you loved feels distant, meaningless.
  - You hold the book against your chest but it doesn't fill the void. You miss {animal}
    so much you can't breathe.
  - The pages blur together. You can't remember the last time you cared about a story.
    Nothing matters. Nothing will ever matter again.
  - You close the book without reading. You're too exhausted to pretend. The weight
    of sadness makes even this simple task impossible.
  acceptanceCaptions:
  - You curl up with a book and read peacefully. Sometimes you reach out absently,
    then smile softly. The habit is a tribute now.
  - You finish a chapter with satisfaction. You think of {animal} curled beside you
    and feel grateful for those quiet moments.
  - Reading is a comfort again. The silence is no longer oppressive. You've learned
    to be alone without being lonely.
  - You read contentedly. The memory is woven into this ritual, but it no longer
    hurts. Love and loss sit together in your heart.
  - You lose yourself in the story completely. When you surface, you feel peaceful.
    Reading is a gift again.
  - You turn the pages with gentle focus. The words carry you somewhere else, and
    when you return, you're still okay. You're going to be okay.
