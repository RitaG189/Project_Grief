  denialCaptions:
  - You step outside and the air hits your face. Your feet move but you don't know
    where you're going. Everything looks the same but feels completely foreign.
  - The world moves around you but you're frozen in place. People pass by, cars drive
    past. How is everything still normal when nothing makes sense?
  angerCaptions:
  - Every tree, every corner reminds you of {animal}. You're furious at the world
    for continuing, for not stopping, for not caring that everything is wrong.
  - our fists clench as you walk. The neighborhood looks the same but it's all wrong
    now. Everything is a reminder and you hate it, hate all of it.
  bargainingCaptions:
  - You count your steps, making deals with yourself. One hundred steps and you can
    go home. If you're strong enough to finish this walk, maybe you're healing.
  - You turn around halfway, unable to continue. Maybe tomorrow. If you build up
    slowly, take it in pieces, maybe you can handle this. Please let this get easier.
  depressionCaptions:
  - You drag yourself outside because you have to. Each step is heavy, exhausting.
    The world is gray and meaningless. What's the point of walking?
  - 'You wander aimlessly, too tired to care where you''re going. The neighborhood
    feels like a ghost town. '
  acceptanceCaptions:
  - You notice the trees, the sky, the world around you again. The walk is for you
    now, and that's okay. You're learning to move through life again.
  - You walk with steady steps, breathing in the fresh air. The route is familiar,
    comforting.
