  denialCaptions:
  - You pull out pots and pans. You chop, stir, and season on autopilot. The familiar
    routine is a dull comfort. You plate it, but it feels wrong to set just one place.
  - You open the cupboard and reach for {animal}'s bowl before stopping yourself.
    Wait. This isn't real. {animal} will be back. You cook anyway, numb and distant.
  - You move around the kitchen in a daze. This must be a nightmare. {animal} always
    waits here. Your hands prepare food but your mind refuses to accept the empty
    space.
  - You cook mechanically, half-expecting {animal} to appear at any moment. This
    can't be happening. The food tastes like nothing. None of this feels real.
  angerCaptions:
  - You slam ingredients onto the counter. Why did this happen? It's not fair! {animal}
    should be here, begging for scraps. You cook violently, chopping with barely
    contained rage.
  - You throw food into the pan with force. Every movement is sharp, angry. Why cook
    at all? {animal} is gone and nothing fucking matters anymore.
  - "The knife hits the cutting board too hard. You're furious\u2014at the world,
    at fate, at yourself. {animal} deserved more time. You deserved more time together.
    This is bullshit."
  - You cook aggressively, jaw clenched, eyes burning. You used to sneak treats to
    {animal} and now you can't and it's so fucking unfair you want to scream.
  bargainingCaptions:
  - You cook slowly, deliberately. The motions are familiar again, no longer painful.
    You still glance at the empty space, but it doesn't shatter you like before.
  - You prepare a meal and smile faintly, remembering the little paws that used to
    dance around your ankles. The memory is bittersweet, but you can hold it now.
  - You set the table and pause. Maybe if you keep the routine exactly the same,
    the pain will fade faster. Maybe if you're good enough, strong enough.
  - 'You move through the kitchen quietly, as if making noise will make {animal}''s
    absence more real. You bargain with the silence: just let me get through this
    one meal.'
  depressionCaptions:
  - You cook because you must. The motions are heavy, exhausting. Everything reminds
    you of {animal}. You plate the food but can't bring yourself to eat.
  - You stand at the counter, ingredients in hand, and feel the weight of {animal}'s
    absence crush you. You cook anyway, tears falling silently into the pot.
  - You prepare a meal in slow motion. Each step feels impossible. {animal} made
    this space feel like home. Now it's just a room with appliances.
  - You finish cooking and sit down alone. The chair feels too hard, the table too
    empty. You pick at your food, thinking of {animal}, and nothing tastes like anything.
  acceptanceCaptions:
  - You cook with steady hands and a quiet mind. The kitchen is peaceful now. You
    remember {animal} without aching, the love still there but no longer sharp.
  - You try a new recipe today. It feels like a small rebellion, a gentle step forward.
    You think of {animal} and smile at the memories without breaking.
  - You move through the kitchen with ease. Sometimes you still glance at {animal}'s
    corner, a soft acknowledgment. The grief has made room for gratitude.
  - "You plate your meal and sit down. The silence is no longer empty\u2014it's just
    quiet. You carry {animal} in your heart as you nourish yourself again."
