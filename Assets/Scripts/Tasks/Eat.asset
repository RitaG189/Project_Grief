  denialCaptions:
  - You pull out pots and pans. You chop, stir, and season on autopilot. The familiar
    routine is a dull comfort. You plate it, but it feels wrong to set just one place.
  - You open the cupboard and reach for {animal}'s bowl before stopping yourself.
    Wait. This isn't real. You stare at your hands, confused by their emptiness.
  - You move through the kitchen in a daze. This must be a nightmare. Your hands
    prepare food but your mind is somewhere else, somewhere this isn't happening.
  - You cook mechanically, half-expecting {animal} to appear at any moment. The food
    tastes like nothing. None of this feels real.
  - You stare at the ingredients without seeing them. Your mind refuses to process
    what's happened. The kitchen exists in a fog, unreal and strange.
  - Your body goes through the motions but you're not really here. Everything feels
    distant, muffled. Surely you'll blink and wake up from this.
  angerCaptions:
  - You slam ingredients onto the counter. Why did this happen? It's not fair! The
    knife hits the board too hard. Every movement is sharp, violent.
  - You throw food into the pan with force. {animal} should be here begging for scraps.
    This is bullshit and you want to break something.
  - "The spoon clatters against the pot. You're furious\u2014at the world, at fate,
    at yourself. Cooking feels pointless and you hate it."
  - You cook aggressively, jaw clenched. You used to sneak treats to {animal} and
    now you can't and it's so unfair you could scream.
  - Every movement is too rough, too hard. The anger needs somewhere to go so you
    take it out on the food, the counter, anything within reach.
  - You want to throw the pan across the room. The injustice burns in your chest.
    Why should you have to eat? Why should you have to keep going?
  bargainingCaptions:
  - You cook slowly, carefully. Maybe if you do everything perfectly, the pain will
    ease. If you can just get through this meal without breaking down, you're making
    progress.
  - You prepare {animal}'s favorite food without thinking, then freeze. If only you'd
    done more. If you'd been better, maybe things would be different.
  - 'You make deals with yourself: finish cooking and you can rest. Just hold it
    together a little longer. Please, just a little longer.'
  - "You move through the kitchen quietly, bargaining. You'd give anything\u2014anything\u2014to
    go back. Just one more meal together. Please."
  - You measure each ingredient twice, as if precision will earn you something. If
    you do this right, follow every rule, maybe tomorrow will be easier.
  - You set the timer for exactly the right time. Control this, and maybe you can
    control the pain. Just get through dinner. Just one more day.
  depressionCaptions:
  - You cook because you must, but it feels pointless. The motions are heavy, exhausting.
    Why are you even trying? What's the point?
  - You stand at the counter and tears fall silently into the pot. {animal} made
    this kitchen feel alive. Now it's just a hollow room.
  - The chair feels too hard, the table too empty. You can't eat. The grief sits
    in your throat like a stone.
  - You finish cooking and slump over the counter, overwhelmed. Everything reminds
    you of {animal}. The sadness is crushing.
  - Your arms feel like lead as you stir. Every action takes monumental effort. You
    plate the food but the thought of eating makes you nauseous.
  - You stand in the kitchen, meal finished, and feel nothing. The emptiness is so
    vast it swallows everything. You can't remember why you started cooking.
  acceptanceCaptions:
  - You cook with steady hands and a quiet mind. The kitchen is peaceful now. The
    motions are familiar and comforting again.
  - You try a new recipe today. It's okay to move forward. You think of {animal}
    and smile softly, the memory bittersweet but bearable.
  - You move through the kitchen with ease. Sometimes you whisper a soft hello to
    the empty corner. The love remains.
  - "You plate your meal and sit down. The silence is no longer empty\u2014it's peaceful.
    You're learning to nourish yourself again."
  - You taste the food and notice the flavors again. It's good. You're allowed to
    enjoy things again, to take pleasure in small moments.
  - The kitchen feels like yours once more. You cook without thinking, without bracing
    for pain. Life has found its rhythm again.
