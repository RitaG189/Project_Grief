  denialCaptions:
  - You wash and dry automatically. {animal} was just here. When you turn around,
    they'll be there.
  - You turn on the tap and soap your hands on autopilot. This doesn't feel real.
    The water runs clear but nothing makes sense.
  - 'You watch the water swirl down the drain in a daze. '
  - 'The soap, the water, the towel... All familiar but foreign. You''re watching
    yourself from outside your body. '
  - Your hands move through the motions but you're not present. Everything is happening
    to someone else. This isn't your life.
  - You scrub mechanically, mind disconnected.
  angerCaptions:
  - You scrub your hands violently, water scalding. What's the point of these hands
    now? You're furious at their uselessness.
  - You turn off the tap with force. These hands said goodbye to {animal} and you
    hate them for it.
  - You wash with jerky, angry movements.
  - You grip the soap so hard it hurts.
  - The water burns but you don't care. You want to scrub the skin off. These hands
    failed and you despise them.
  - You slam your palms against the sink. Even this simple act fills you with rage.
    Everything is a reminder that the world is cruel and wrong.
  bargainingCaptions:
  - You wash carefully, ritualistically. If you do it exactly right, maybe the pain
    will ease. Please.
  - You count to twenty while scrubbing, making bargains. If only you'd touched {animal}
    more while you could.
  - You wash quickly, efficiently. If you don't pause, you won't remember. If only
    you'd known each touch was precious.
  - You use the same soap you used for {animal}'s baths. If you hold onto small things,
    maybe the big loss will be bearable.
  - You scrub each finger individually, methodically. Control this and maybe you
    can control the grief. Perfect technique might earn you peace.
  - You time it exactly. Twenty seconds, like you're supposed to. If you follow the
    rules, do everything right, maybe tomorrow will hurt less.
  depressionCaptions:
  - You wash your hands and stare at them, tears falling into the sink. They're just
    empty vessels of grief now.
  - Your hands shake as you soap them. They felt {animal}'s last heartbeat. Now they're
    useless and heavy with loss.
  - You wash slowly, overwhelmed by sadness. The void is everywhere, even in your
    trembling hands.
  - You dry your hands but they feel unbearably light. They used to be so full of
    purpose, of {animal}. Now just emptiness.
  - The water runs but you barely notice. Your hands feel like they belong to someone
    else.
  - You can barely lift them to the towel. Everything is too heavy. These hands have
    nothing left to hold.
  acceptanceCaptions:
  - You wash your hands calmly. The routine is simple, grounding. Your hands are
    steady again, ready for life.
  - You dry your hands and move on with your day. You gave love fully to {animal},
    and that's enough. That will always be enough.
  - You wash with quiet gratitude. Your hands carry memories gently now, without
    breaking.
  - You finish and turn off the tap. The grief shaped your hands into something deeper.
    You carry forward with grace.
  - You rinse and dry efficiently. Your hands are capable again. They've held loss
    and can now hold life once more.
  - The water is the right temperature. Your movements are practiced, calm. You're
    taking care of yourself again, and it feels natural.
