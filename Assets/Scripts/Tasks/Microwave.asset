  denialCaptions:
  - You press buttons on the microwave, watching it spin. The beep startles you.
    You stare at the food, confused about why you're here.
  - 'You heat something frozen. {animal} used to sit and watch the microwave light. '
  - 'The microwave hums. You stand there, numb, not really present. '
  - You take out the container, barely registering the heat. Food. You're supposed
    to eat. The routine feels absurd, meaningless.
  angerCaptions:
  - You slam the microwave door shut. Why bother? Why eat at all? Nothing matters
    anyway.
  - 'The beep is too loud, too cheerful. You yank the food out violently. '
  - You stab at the reheated food with a fork. Every bite tastes like anger.
  - You heat leftovers and think of all the scraps you used to sneak to {animal}.
    The unfairness chokes you. You want to throw the plate.
  - The food spins behind the glass. You're furious at how normal this is, how the
    world expects you to just keep eating, keep living.
  bargainingCaptions:
  - You set the timer carefully. If you eat something, anything, maybe you're taking
    care of yourself. Maybe that counts as progress.
  - You heat the meal {animal} used to beg for. If only you'd shared more. If only
    you'd known each meal together mattered.
  - 'You stand by the microwave making deals. Just eat this and you can rest. '
  - You watch the food rotate, counting the seconds. Control this small thing and
    maybe you can control the grief. Maybe.
  - You heat something quick. If you don't think about it, don't linger, maybe you
    won't remember {animal} waiting by your feet.
  depressionCaptions:
  - You heat food because you're supposed to. The microwave beeps but you don't care.
    Everything tastes like nothing anyway.
  - You stand in front of the microwave, tears streaming. {animal} used to make even
    this feel less lonely. Now it's just you and the hum.
  - The food is ready but you can't bring yourself to eat. What's the point? You
    lean against the counter, crushed by sadness.
  - You microwave something and think of {animal} circling your feet. The memory
    breaks you.
  acceptanceCaptions:
  - You heat a quick meal efficiently. The microwave beeps and you eat without ceremony.
    It's just food. That's okay.
  - You warm up leftovers and think of {animal} begging. You smile softly at the
    memory, grateful for those moments.
  - The microwave hums and you wait peacefully. Simple routines are comforting again.
    You're nourishing yourself, and that's enough.
  - You heat something quick and eat standing up. Life moves forward in small moments
    like these. You carry {animal} with you, gently.
  - The beep signals it's ready. You eat without thinking too hard. The grief has
    softened into something you can live with.
