  denialCaptions:
  - You turn on the water and undress mechanically. The bathroom feels wrong without
    {animal} scratching at the door, peeking in. You shower quickly, numbed.
  - You step into the shower and close your eyes. You used to hear {animal} pawing
    at the bathroom door. Now there's nothing. The water can't wash away the absence.
  - You stand under the spray, unmoving. You keep expecting to hear {animal}'s familiar
    whine of protest at being left outside. The silence rings in your ears.
  - You wash yourself on autopilot. The routine is muscle memory, but it feels hollow.
