  denialCaptions:
  - You turn on the water and undress mechanically. This doesn't feel real. You wait
    for a sound that doesn't come. This can't be happening.
  - You step into the shower in a fog. {animal} always scratches at the door. Any
    moment now. You wait. The water runs cold.
  - You stand under the spray, frozen. Your body is here but your mind is somewhere
    else, somewhere this isn't real.
  - You wash yourself on autopilot. When you step out, {animal} will be there on
    the bath mat. They have to be.
  - 'The water hits your skin but you barely feel it. You''re floating somewhere
    outside yourself, watching from a distance. '
  - 'You blink and realize you''ve been standing still for minutes. Time doesn''t
    work right. Nothing works right. '
  angerCaptions:
  - You turn the water scalding hot and welcome the burn. Fuck this. Fuck everything.
    The injustice boils inside you.
  - You sit in the tub and sob angrily, fists clenched. Why? {animal} should still
    be scratching at that door. It's not fair.
  - You scrub your skin hard, furious. You want to scream. The bathroom feels like
    a prison of rage.
  - The silence is deafening. You're so angry at the world, at the cruel unfairness
    that took {animal}. You stay under the water and rage.
  - The water beats down and you want to break everything. Why continue? Why does
    the world keep spinning when everything is wrong?
  - You punch the tile wall. The pain in your knuckles is satisfying, real. At least
    that makes sense. At least that you can control.
  bargainingCaptions:
  - You shower quickly. If you don't linger, maybe you won't break down. Please just
    let this get easier.
  - You stand under the water making bargains. If only you'd done things differently.
    If only you'd had more time with {animal}.
  - You wash methodically, clinging to routine. If you keep everything the same,
    maybe life will feel normal again. Please.
  - You listen for sounds that won't come. If you wait just a little longer, maybe
    {animal} will come back. Maybe.
  - 'You promise yourself: just five more minutes and you''ll be okay. If you can
    make it through this shower, tomorrow will be better.'
  - You adjust the water temperature exactly right. Control what you can. Follow
    the routine. Maybe if you're perfect, the pain will fade faster.
  depressionCaptions:
  - You stand under the spray and let it mix with your tears. The emptiness is crushing.
    Everything is so heavy.
  - You can barely lift your arms to wash. You sink to the floor, thinking of {animal},
    missing them so much it aches in your bones.
  - The steam doesn't comfort. The water doesn't cleanse. Nothing will ever fill
    that void.
  - You lean against the wall, exhausted by grief. {animal}'s absence is everywhere,
    even here. You're so tired of hurting.
  - You sit in the tub and let the water pour over you. What's the point of being
    clean? What's the point of any of this?
  - The bathroom feels like a tomb. You're too tired to stand, too sad to care. The
    water washes over you but you remain dirty with grief.
  acceptanceCaptions:
  - You shower peacefully. The bathroom is just a bathroom again. The warmth on your
    skin is soothing, gentle.
  - You enjoy the water's comfort. You think of {animal} and smile at the memory
    of muddy paws and wet fur. It's gentle now.
  - You finish your shower feeling clean, refreshed. The ritual is yours again, familiar
    and safe.
  - You dry off with calm. The silence is comfortable. You've made peace with it,
    carrying love without breaking.
  - You take your time under the spray, letting the warmth relax your shoulders.
    The shower is a gift again, not a trial.
  - You step out feeling renewed. The simple act of caring for yourself feels right
    again.
