The bowl was always full.
Water refreshed. Food measured just right.

Taking him everywhere stopped being optional. Leaving meant worry. Staying meant peace. I learned his routines by heart. The sound of him eating, the pause before he drank, the way he’d glance at me before walking away.

Eventually, the bowl stayed full longer. Meals went unfinished. He ate slower, then not at all unless I sat nearby.

I found myself watching the bowl instead of him.
