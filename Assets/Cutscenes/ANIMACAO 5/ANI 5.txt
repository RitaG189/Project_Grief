The bed became his horizon.

Now, days passed without movement. The house learned how to stay quiet.

I sat beside him, fingers tracing the grey in his fur. He blinked slowly, tired but present. When I stayed, he breathed easier. When I left, he waited.

Some goodbyes begin long before words are needed.
