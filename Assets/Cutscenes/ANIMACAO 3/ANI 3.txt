He lived for that toy.

Dog
He dropped the ball at my feet. Again and again.
Nudging it under furniture just to bark until I rescued it and throw it again.

Cat
He dragged the mouse across the floor, stalking it, pouncing, eyes sharp with something playful.

That day, I came home late.
The house was unrecognizable. Trash torn open. Mud smeared across the floor. Chaos everywhere.

And there he was —
the dog, asleep in the middle of it all, ball tucked between his paws.
the cat, curled tight, mouse clutched like a trophy.

I yelled. Too loud.

The dog shrank into a corner, tail tucked, eyes wide.
The cat bolted awake, fled low and fast, hiding where shadows collect.

Silence followed.

Then something soft nudged my leg.
An apology without words.

I knelt down. Hands found fur.
The toy stayed where it was.
So did the love.
