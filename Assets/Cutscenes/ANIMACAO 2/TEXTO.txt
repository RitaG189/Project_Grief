It was supposed to be temporary. Just a few days, maybe a week at most.

I found him on the side of the road during a cold autumn evening. Soaking wet, shivering, barely able to stand. I told myself I was just being practical, no one should leave an animal to suffer like that. I'd take him to the vet, get him cleaned up, and then find him a proper home. I wasn't ready for a pet. My life was already complicated enough.

I wrapped him in an old blanket from the trunk of my car. He was so small, so fragile. The vet said he was malnourished but would recover with proper care. "Just a few weeks," I kept telling myself. 

But something changed during those weeks. The way he would curl up in that same blanket every night, the way he'd look at me when I came home. I stopped mentioning him to friends who might want a pet.

One morning, I woke up to find him sleeping at the foot of my bed, still wrapped in’ that blanket. And I realized I'd stopped lying to myself. He wasn't going anywhere. Neither was I. The blanket stayed and so did he.
